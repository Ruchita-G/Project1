# Project1
Mitchel, Dylan, Ruchita and Katja's first project

# Function
Our website allows the user to input any movie to find the information about that movie and the soundtrack.

#How It Works
When a movie is entered, the website will pull specific objects of information from the OMDB API, create a container, and append the image of the movie and snippets such as director, year, and plot. At the same time, a button will appear above the title of the movie that when clicked will use Spotify's API to produce a new page on Spotify's web player with the soundtrack of that movie. 

#The finished project. 
When you come to our site, first you click to log into Spotify and then directed back to our site. There you type in a movie name.  The movie's information from the OMBd API appears as well as the movie trailer from the YouTube API, which is shown on the bottom of the page.  A button appears that states "To Spotify soundtrack" which will take you to the tab with the soundtrack available to play. We also added two list that are stored in firebase. One has the last three searches.  The other keeps track of the five most popular searches.
